* If you can't play a card, click the "Draw Deck" to draw one card, which ends your turn.

#### 3.  **🧠 The Quizmaster Twist!**
* **Escaping CPU's Cards:** If the COMPUTER plays an Action Card, a Wild Card, or an Even Numbered card on you, a question popup will appear!
    * ✅ **Answer Correctly:** You nullify the card's effect and the COMPUTER's turn is wasted!
    * ❌ **Answer Incorrectly:** You suffer the card's penalty (e.g., draw cards, skip turn). For Action/Wild cards, you draw **one extra card**, and for Even Number cards, you draw **two extra cards**.

#### 4.  **Winning the Game**
* The first player to empty their hand wins!
* When a player is down to their last card, the game automatically announces "UNO!".
* Each game is a fresh start; there is no cumulative scoring.

## 🤖 How the COMPUTER Plays!

The COMPUTER isn't just playing random cards! It uses a dynamic strategy:

* **Identifies Playable Cards:** It scans its hand for all valid moves.
* **Strategic Decision:** It may play aggressively with high-value Action Cards if you have few cards left, or play conservatively to save its power plays for later.
* **Smart Color Choice:** When playing a Wild card, it intelligently picks the color that is most common in its remaining hand.

## 🤖 How the COMPUTER Plays!

The COMPUTER uses a dynamic strategy to challenge you:

* **Identifies Playable Cards:** It scans its hand for all valid moves.
* **Strategic Decision:** A random factor influences its choice. It may play aggressively with high-value Action Cards if you have few cards left, or play conservatively with low-number cards to save its power plays for later.
* **Smart Color Choice:** When playing a Wild card, it intelligently picks the color that is most common in its remaining hand.
